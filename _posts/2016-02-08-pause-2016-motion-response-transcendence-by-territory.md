description: "\"In 2020, man's technological capabilities reached the average potential processing power of the human brain. It wasn't so long after, that the equivalent of all human thought to have ever transpired throughout time, would come to pass in but a fleeting moment. We became omniscient, and boundless in our capabilities."
